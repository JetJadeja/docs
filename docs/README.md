# Rari Capital Documentation


## Background

The Rari Capital contributors are in pursuit of one goal: how to enable the most amount of people to earn the most amount of yield. 

The pursuit of this goal began with our yield aggregator. The yield aggregator was Rari Capital's first product and enables anyone to instantly deposit a supported crypto-asset into a pool for it to be continiously rebalanced for the highest yield. 

Then came along Fuse which began as a fork of Compound Finance but enabled anyone to spin up their own money markets. Additionally we have various other products in the pipeline: Nova and tanks just to mention a few. Have fun and good luck building as you explore the documentation! If you have any questions, feel free to ask in our Discord.
